This is a crowd funding project where I modified and analyzed sample data to try to uncover market trends.
I used conditional formatting with color scales.
I created new columns in the data set.
I used formulas to fill the new columns.
I used a formula to split a single column into two separate columns.
I created pivot tables and stacked column pivot charts to visualize by category, sub catgeory and, year.
I created an analysis of funding goals.
I created a summary statistic tab where I pulled mean, median, min, max, variance and, standard deviation
